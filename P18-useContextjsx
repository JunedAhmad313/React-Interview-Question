Ques - What is Use Context in react ?

Ans - useContext" is a hook that allows you to access the data stored in the context of your application. 
      Context in React is a way to share data between components without having to pass props manually at
      every level of the component tree. 
      
      How "useContext" works:
      
      
      Creating a Context: First, you need to create a context using the React.createContext() function. 
                          This creates a context object that has a Provider component and a Consumer component.
                          
                          
                          
                          
      Providing Context: You wrap the part of your component tree where you want to share data with a Context.
                         Provider component. This provider component takes a value prop, which is the data you 
                         want to share
                         
     Consuming Context: To access the data from the context, you use the useContext hook in a child component of 
                        the provider. This hook takes the context object you created and returns the current context value
                        
                        */

import React, { createContext, useContext } from "react";

// Create a context
const MyContext = createContext();

// Provide the context data in a parent component
function App() {
  const contextData = "Hello from Context!";

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={contextData}>
      <ChildComponent />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}

// Consume the context data in a child component
function ChildComponent() {
  const dataFromContext = useContext(MyContext);

  return <div>{dataFromContext}</div>;
}

export default App;
